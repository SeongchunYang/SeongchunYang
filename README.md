Seongchun Yang here, or more commmonly known as **SC**.

I'm a bioinformatician? a computational biologist? I guess I am whatever you call me.

I work on modeling animal behaviors and analysing RNA data in mostly neurodevelopment arena.

Perhaps due to the nature of my work, my repo looks like a car crash of various things I've worked on previously and currently.

Most of the content here are for archival purposes as much as to publish the code. I'd rather write down the particular things I've done previously so that I don't have to extensively re-do everything from the start. But in doing so, maybe it will help you. Just grab something and find out!
